## 💡 核心提分点解析
### 词汇升级 (Vocabulary):

 - 用 "deliver a presentation" 替代 give a presentation（更具职场范儿）。

 - 用 "logistical details" 替代 problems to consult（更地道）。

 - 用 "tailor the content" 替代 prepare specific contents（展现高阶表达能力）。

 - 用 "expected number of participants" 直接对应题目要求，显得精准高效。

### 语法与衔接 (Cohesion):

 - 使用了 "I would appreciate it if you could..."，这是非常稳的 CLB 10 高级礼貌句型。

 - 通过 "Regarding..." 和 "First and foremost" 建立清晰的段落逻辑，非常有利于机器抓取关键词。

### 纠正细微错误:

 - Equipment 是不可数名词，不能加 s。原稿中的 all of the equipments 已修正为 equipment。

## 我的回答
Hi Jim,

I am delighted to give a presentation in your company. I have some problems to consult with you.

I don't know where your company is located. Could you please forward the detailed address? And please also tell me when the suitable time slot is for the presentation. Besides that, I am wondering will your company prepare the computer and projector then? I can take mine if all of the equipments are occupied.
Lastly, could you see who will join the presentation? Then I could prepare some specific contents.

I am looking forward to receiving your message.

Best regards,
Travis
