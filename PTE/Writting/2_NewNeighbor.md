 - give you some hints -> **provide some practical suggestions**. ("Hints" 偏向暗示，建议用 "suggestions")。
 - Parking problem is easier that... -> **Regarding the parking issue, it is quite straightforward to resolve by....** (句子结构太散，需要连接词)。

## 我的原文

Hi John,

I'm glad you move to our community. Regarding the problems you mentioned last time, I could give you some hints to resolve them.

About the noise from your left neighbor Jerry, I suppose he would not know you have moved in. Because your house had been empty for a long time. I think it's fine to tell him and he is friendly to reduce the noise.
Parking problem is easier that you could ask the community house manager to rent one visitor parking lot.
And the last problem about the garbage, you could ask the municipal to get a bigger garbage bin for your extra garbage.

Hope you have a great living experience here.

Best regards,
Travis

Dear John,

I am **delighted** that you **have joined** our community, and I am writing to follow up on our recent conversation regarding the minor issues you have encountered.

Regarding the noise from your neighbor, Jerry, it is likely he is unaware of your arrival since the property was vacant for an extended period. **I recommend having** a friendly chat with him, as he is generally very considerate and would likely diminish the volume if asked politely.

Furthermore, the parking situation can be easily addressed. **I suggest contacting** the community manager to inquire about leasing an additional visitor parking stall for your convenience. Lastly, concerning the garbage accumulation, you may submit a request to the local municipality for a larger bin to accommodate your household waste.

I hope these solutions prove helpful. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance.

Best regards,

Travis
