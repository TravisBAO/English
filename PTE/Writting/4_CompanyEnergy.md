## 💡 核心修改说明（提分关键）
### 纠正拼写与语法错误：
 - Shutted down $\rightarrow$ Shut down: shut 的过去分词依然是 shut，没有 shutted 这个词。
 - Benefital $\rightarrow$ Beneficial: 修正拼写。Happen $\rightarrow$ 
 - Happy: 原文中是笔误。
 - Consuption equipement $\rightarrow$ Energy consumption: 修正拼写并调整为更地道的名词短语。
### 词汇升级 (Vocabulary):
 - 用 optimizing (优化) 替代基础的 turning off。
 - 用 extinguished (熄灭) 替代基础的 turned off，展现词汇深度。 - 用 sustainability efforts (可持续发展努力) 替代 contribution，更符合现代办公语境。
### 句式结构：
 - 使用了 "It would be highly beneficial to..."。这是一个非常稳的 CLB 10 句型。
 - 使用了 "ensure lights are extinguished..." 的被动从句。

### 我的回答
Dear Mrs Smith,

I was delighted to learn about the upcoming energy saving plan of our company and would like to offer some practical suggestions.

First and foremost, I recommend turning of the lights when they are not being used. It would be an excellent way to purchase some smart light sensors and automatic switches to turn on or off the lights. Regarding the computers, they should be shutted down when people are off for work. Lastly, it would be benefital that the last colleague, who leaves the office, turns off the heating and air-conditioning, as they are the most energy consuption equipement in the company.

I am more than happen to participate the company's contribution.

Best regards,
Travis

Dear Mrs. Smith,

I was delighted to learn about our company’s upcoming energy-saving plan and would like to offer some practical suggestions.

First and foremost, I **recommend optimizing** our **lighting usage**. **It would be highly beneficial** to install smart sensors and automatic switches to ensure **lights are extinguished when not in use.** Regarding office **equipment**, all computers should be properly **shut down** after work hours to prevent unnecessary power drainage. Lastly, I **suggest that** the **final employee leaving the office** should verify that the heating and air-conditioning systems are turned off, as these represent our highest **energy consumption**.

I am more than happy to support the company’s sustainability efforts.

Best regards,
