## 提分关键点解析
### 词汇升级 (Vocabulary):

 - 将 near 改为 adjacent to（高级方位词）。

 - 将 metal belt 改为 metal strap（更地道的皮包肩带表达）。

 - 将 find 改为 housed 或 contained within（展现多样性）。

 - 引入 verification purposes（用于身份核实），这是典型的地道商务用语。

### 句式复杂性 (Grammar):

 - 被动语态: “My friends and I were seated...” 机器非常看重被动语态的使用。

 - **虚拟语气/条件句: “Should the bag be located...” (万一包被找到了...)，这种倒装结构是 CLB 10 的核心加分项。**

 - 非谓语动词: “...black bag featuring a long metal strap...” 减少了简单句的堆砌。

### 衔接与逻辑 (Cohesion):

 - 使用 “Contained within” 作为段落连接，比直接说 "And" 要高级得多。

 - 结尾使用 “at your earliest convenience” 是标准的职场邮件礼貌用语。


### 我的回答
Dear restaurant manager,

I am writing this letter to inquire about my missing bag.

My friends and I had dinner at your restaurant yesterday and we sat at the table near the bar. Unfortunately I forgot my bag when I left the restaurant.
It is a black bag with a long metal belt, and without any brand on the exterior. And you could find a wallet and a power bank in it and also my driver's license.

Could you please check if anyone found it? Please reach out to me via my number 345-434-3333. I really appreciate your assistance.

Best regards,
Travis
